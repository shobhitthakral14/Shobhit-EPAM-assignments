// In C++, the this pointer is an implicit pointer available in non-static member functions of a class. 
// It refers to the calling object â€” the object for which the member function is currently invoked.

class Demo {
    int x;
public:
    void setX(int x) {
        this->x = x; // Resolving ambiguity using this pointer
    }
};


//When local variables or function parameters have the same name as class members, this-> helps differentiate.  

// not present in static function as static function don't belong to an object 


// used in method chaining
#include<iostream>
class Demo {
    int a;
public:
    Demo& setA(int a) {
        this->a = a;

// we cannot assign another object address to this as this is a const pointer -its value(address) cannot be changed

// this can be dereferrenced to give you the current object *this

// it is useful in method chaining and operator overloading
