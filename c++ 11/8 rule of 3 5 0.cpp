Rule of 3 :-

 

   * If a class manages a resource (e.g., dynamic memory, file handle) and defines any of the following, it should define all three:
   1)* Destructor
   2)* Copy Constructor
   3)* Copy Assignment Operator
   * This rule ensures proper resource management for classes with value semantics, particularly before C++11.
   * The compiler-generated default versions perform shallow copies, which can lead to:
    * Memory leaks
    * Double deletion
    * Incorrect resource sharing
   Why is the Rule of Three Important?
   1)Prevents memory leaks and dangling pointers.
   2)Ensures proper copying behavior for dynamically allocated resources.
   3)Avoids double deletion issues in destructors.

   // Compiler-generated copy constructor and assignment operator do shallow copies. If two objects delete the same pointer — it causes undefined behavior.
 

   class MyClass {
    int* data;

public:
    MyClass(int val) {
        data = new int(val);  // manual resource allocation
    }

    ~MyClass() {
        delete data;  // need a destructor
    }

    // Copy constructor
    MyClass(const MyClass& other) {
        data = new int(*other.data);
    }

    // Copy assignment
    MyClass& operator=(const MyClass& other) {
        if (this != &other) {
            delete data;
            data = new int(*other.data);
        }
        return *this;
    }
};




Rule Of 5 :-
   *The Rule of Five extends the Rule of Three in C++ by adding move semantics introduced in C++11.
   It ensures efficient resource management and prevents unnecessary deep copies.
   * Consequently, you should implement the rule of 5 for such classes
   * If a class has ownership semantics, then you must provide a user-defined
     * Destructor
     * Copy constructor
     * Copy assignment operator
     * Move constructor
     * Move assignment operator
   * This is to ensure proper handling of the underlying resource
   * Why is the Rule of Five Important?
     *Prevents memory leaks and dangling pointers.
     *Ensures efficient resource management.
     *Enables move semantics for better performance.
     *Avoids unnecessary deep copies, improving speed.
   *When to Use the Rule of Five?
     *When a class manages dynamic memory.
     *When implementing resource-managing classes (e.g., file handles, sockets, smart pointers).
     *When dealing with large objects where moving is preferable to copying.

 

Rule of 0 :-
   *The Rule of Zero is a modern C++ design principle that states that user-defined special member functions (destructor, copy/move constructors, and copy/move assignment operators) should be avoided
   by leveraging RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) and standard library containers like std::unique_ptr and std::shared_ptr for resource management.
   * If a class does not have ownership semantics, then do not provide any user defined function from the rule of 5
   * This is called the "rule of 0"
   * This way the compiler will automatically synthesize the necessary functions
   * Providing user-defined implementation of some functions will prevent the compiler from synthesizing others
   * Basically is totally depends on RAII concept.
   *Why Use the Rule of Zero?
      *Reduces boilerplate code and manual resource management.
      *Avoids memory leaks and dangling pointers.
      *Increases exception safety.
      *Takes advantage of modern C++ features (smart pointers, containers, etc.).
   *When to Use the Rule of Zero?
      1)When using RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization).
      2)When working with standard library containers (e.g., std::vector, std::string, std::shared_ptr).
      3)When writing modern, maintainable C++ code that avoids manual memory management.
