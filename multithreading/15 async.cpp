// TOPIC : std::async(automatic thread creation)
// it is capable of returning the result unlike promise and future combination                     
// deffered locking system -> create a new thread and that will run when we do future object.get()
// async locking system ->does not create new thread but perform operation in main thread only



// std::async is a C++ standard library utility that runs a task asynchronously (possibly in a separate thread) and returns a std::future<T> to retrieve the result.

//std::async is a higher-level abstraction and handles thread creation, promise, and future management automatically. It simplifies code and reduces boilerplate.

 


//NOTES
//1.It runs a function asynchronously (potentially in a new thread) and returns a std::future that will hold the result.
//2.There are three launch policies for creating task  :
//   a. std::launch::async           (Forces immediate execution in a new thread.)
//   b. std::launch::deferred        (execution is deferred until .get() or .wait() is called (runs in calling thread).)
//   c. std::launch::async | std::launch::deffered     (default) â€“ Implementation chooses.


// Aspect	        std::launch::async	        std::launch::deferred

// Thread	        Runs in new thread	        Runs in main thread (lazy)
// Execution	    Starts immediately	        Starts on get() or wait()
// Concurrency	    Yes	                        No
// Overhead	        More (thread creation)	    Less




// HOW IT WORKS have a college practical scheduled and need to take leave for it. Piyush has already received the official mail from the college regarding this and has advised me to update the same on the vacation portal. Kindly approve the leave.
//1.It automatically creates a thread(or picks from internal thread pool) and a promise object for us.
//2. Then passes the std::promise object to thread function and returns the associated std::future object.
//3. When our passes argument function exists then its value will be sent in this promise object,
//   so eventually return value will be available in std::future object

	std::cout << "Waiting for the result" << std::endl;
	std::cout << "Oddsum :" << fututre_obj.get() << std::endl; // function will execute at this line and we are waiting here(blocking state until we cant get value from function it is in same thread no new thread is created)
	std::cout << std::endl;
	return 0;
}


// we can send functor and lambda function as callback to std::async,it will work the same.
// auto future = std::async([](int a, int b) { return a + b; }, 10, 20);




// what if we don't call future_obj.get()
//If the result is never fetched, it could lead to resource leakage or performance issues, especially with long-running tasks.
