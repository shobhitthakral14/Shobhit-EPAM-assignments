//A friend class can access private and protected members of other classes in which it is declared as a friend.
//It is sometimes useful to allow a particular class to access private and protected members of other classes.
//Remember one thing, Friendship is not mutual.If class A is a friend of B, then B doesnâ€™t become a friend of A automatically.
//We can declare a friend class in C++ by using the friend keyword.
//This breaks encapsulation intentionally to allow tightly coupled classes to interact.


#include<iostream>
class demo {
private:
	int private_variable;
protected:
	int protected_variable;
public:
	demo() {
		private_variable = 10;
		protected_variable = 99;
	}
	friend class test;
};

class test {
public:
	void display(demo& d) {
		std::cout << "The value of Private Variable = "
			<< d.private_variable << std::endl;

// we can make only the specific function of other class as friend 
// class A {
//     friend void B::specificFunc();
// };



// difference between inheritance and friend 

// Friendship grants access without changing the class hierarchy. 
// Inheritance is an "is-a" relationship and allows reuse of implementation.
