//The Standard Template Library(STL) in C++ provides a variety of pre-built data structures known as containers.
//These containers are template classes that store collections of objects and offer various functionalities for manipulating data.
//Here's a breakdown of the main types of STL containers:
// 
//1. Sequence Containers :
//These containers store elements in a sequential order.

//Examples include :
// vector: Dynamic array that allows fast random access.
// list : Doubly linked list that allows fast insertions and deletions anywhere in the list.
// 
//2. Associative Containers :
//These containers store elements in a sorted order, typically for fast retrieval.
//They are based on keys, which are used to organize and access elements.
//Examples include :
// set: Stores unique elements in a sorted order.
// map : Stores key - value pairs, where keys are unique and sorted.
// multiset : Stores elements in a sorted order, allowing duplicates.
// multimap : Stores key - value pairs, allowing duplicate keys.
// 
//3. Unordered Associative Containers :
//Similar to associative containers but do not store elements in a sorted order.
//They use hash functions for fast average lookup.
//Examples include :
// unordered_set: Stores unique elements in no particular order.
// unordered_map : Stores key - value pairs in no particular order.
// unordered_multiset : Stores elements in no particular order, allowing duplicates.
// unordered_multimap : Stores key - value pairs in no particular order, allowing duplicate keys.
// 
//STL containers offer a variety of methods for adding, removing, accessing, and iterating through elements.They are a fundamental part of C++ programming, providing efficient and flexible ways to manage data.
